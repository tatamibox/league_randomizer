# league_randomizer

Project is live @ (https://leaguerandomizer.herokuapp.com/). 
Champion list is incomplete, current supported rules are only jungle and ADC. Will implement everything when I have the time.

All-in-one randomizer website for selecting League of Legends champions during champion select. Built with HTML, CSS/Bootstrap, and JavaScript.

<b> Things I've learned building this project: </b>
  
  - I need to utilize arrow functions more. I did not know about them
  until after this project was created.
  
  - Need to focus more on creating semantic HTML, rather than a bunch
    of directionless divs.
